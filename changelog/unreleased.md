# [Unreleased]

## Added

- `dist/launcher.js` — stdio-to-HTTP bridge that auto-starts the Streamable HTTP server if none is running, then bridges stdin/stdout to it. Lets stdio-only hosts share a single server instance.

## Changed

- Documentation restructured to recommend Streamable HTTP as the primary transport; stdio demoted to collapsible fallback section in README and setup guide.
- Docker documentation updated with HTTP-mode example and pairing note.
